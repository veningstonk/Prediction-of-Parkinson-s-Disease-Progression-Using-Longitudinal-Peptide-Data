# Prediction-of-Parkinson-s-Disease-Progression-Using-Longitudinal-Peptide-Data
This repository presents machine learning models including Random Forest, k-NN, CatBoost, Bagging, Voting, and Stacking to predict Parkinson’s disease progression using longitudinal peptide features (e.g., aromaticity, instability index) and CSF biomarkers from the AMP®PD dataset.
